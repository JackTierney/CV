# Anna Freud
Are a children’s mental health charity with over 60 years’ experience of caring for young minds.

Their focus is entirely on reducing the burden of mental health difficulties carried by children and young people.

They propose a radical change in the way services are offered – putting the child and their families at the centre of their own care and focusing on their needs and strengths.

Bringing an understanding from neuroscience and social science research to pioneer new ways of working. Ways that help children, young people and families to find their own solutions to their difficulties.
We offer these treatments interventions wherever families may be – at home, in hostels, schools, prisons and local communities, as well as in the clinic.
And what we learn we share. By training professionals and students from across the world we have an impact on the lives of children, young people and families far beyond the reach of our services.
